This tool was developed in the course of [Introduction to Programming for Remote Sensing](https://prog-geo.github.io).

With this algorithm, we aimed at providing a quick analysis of cloud cover to any given brazilian municipality or other regions of interest, based on the Sentinel-2 collection from Brazil Data Cube.

The Jupyter Notebook presented here (`cloud_cover_recurrence_tool.ipynb`) illustrates an application of the algorithm over the muniicpality of São Paulo. You can download the notebook and run for your area of interest.
